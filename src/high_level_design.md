# P2P Project â€“ Onion Module

## High Level Design

There'll be 3 active threads for each node categorized as follows:

- API Thread
- P2P Thread
- Round Thread

There'll also be intermediate threads spawned & maanged by the above three threads.

Communication between  threads is handled through dumping/polling channels

### Channels

1. API -> Round
  - Transfering identification information for the destination node.
2. Round -> API
  - Telling API thread that the Onion Tunnel is ready

### API Thread

#### API 1: Build Tunnel

- **Request Type**: `ONION TUNNEL BUILD`
- **Callee**: CM/UI Module
- **Connection Type**: Async
- **Functionality**:
    - Forward data to Round Thread via channel.
    - Wait for response data from the Round Thread.
        - Success: Send `ONION TUNNEL READY` to CM/UI module.
        - Failure:
- 

#### API 2: 



### P2P Thread 

#### P2P Thread 1
- `ONION TUNNEL INCOMING` tells CM/UI module that that there will be incomming onion traffic (Similar to that somebody is calling to you)

### Round Thread



- **Connection**: API Thread
